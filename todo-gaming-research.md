# Research: Optimal To-Do List Structures with Gaming Psychology Integration

## Executive Summary for New Parents

Based on psychological research and productivity science, this document provides specific recommendations for implementing a gamified to-do system tailored for Sam's situation with a 3-week-old baby and family responsibilities.

## 1. Time-Based TAT Categories Framework

### Research-Based Time Categories

**Today (Urgent - High Cognitive Load)**
- Tasks requiring immediate attention (0-24 hours)
- Critical baby care, medical appointments, urgent work deadlines
- Maximum 3-5 items to prevent overwhelm
- Color code: Red/Dark Red

**3-Day (Urgent - Medium Cognitive Load)**
- Important but not immediate (24-72 hours)
- Preparation tasks, planning, non-critical appointments
- Maximum 5-7 items
- Color code: Orange/Yellow

**7-Day (Medium Priority)**
- Week-long goals and maintenance tasks
- Household organization, personal projects, social connections
- Maximum 8-10 items
- Color code: Green/Light Blue

**No Deadline (Low Priority)**
- Long-term projects, nice-to-have tasks
- Learning, hobbies, future planning
- Unlimited items but reviewed weekly
- Color code: Gray/Light Purple

### Psychological Basis
Research shows that time-boxing reduces decision fatigue and provides clear boundaries, essential for new parents experiencing cognitive overload.

- Pre-plan tasks during low-stress times

**Implementation Intentions**
- "If-then" planning: "If baby naps for 30+ minutes, then I'll complete X task"
- Specific time/place triggers for routine tasks
- Backup plans for disrupted schedules

**Progressive Enhancement**

- Celebrate small wins to build momentum
- Adjust expectations based on sleep deprivation levels

**Social Support Theory**
- Share achievements with partner/support system
- Create accountability through daily check-ins
- Join online parent communities for motivation

### Habit Stacking for Parents

**Morning Routine Stack:**
1. Baby feeding → Check today's tasks
2. Diaper change → Quick task prioritization
3. Baby settled → Complete highest priority task

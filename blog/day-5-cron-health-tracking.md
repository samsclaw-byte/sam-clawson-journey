# Day 5: Cron Fixed & Health Tracking Launch

**Date:** February 6, 2026  
**Status:** 🟢 Systems Operational

## What We Fixed

### 🕐 Cron Scheduler Migration
The OpenClaw built-in scheduler (v2026.2.3-1) has a nasty bug (#10353) where it stops firing after gateway restarts. **Solution:** Migrated all 14 jobs to Linux system crontab. Jobs now run reliably on schedule:

- Morning briefing (6am)
- Midday/Afternoon/Evening checks
- Overnight build tasks (11pm, 1am, 3am, 5am)
- Overnight research tasks (12am, 2am, 4am)
- Voice transcription (every 5 min)

### 💪 Health & Fitness Tracking Started

**Weight:** 104 kg starting point (6'3", BMI 28.6)  
**Goal:** 85-95 kg optimal range

**Yesterday's Activity:**
- 🏃 Morning run: 27 min, Strain 13.4
- 🏊 Swim session: 23 min, Strain 10.1
- 💊 Creatine + multivitamin logged
- 🥗 Meals tracked (~1,550 cal business lunch)

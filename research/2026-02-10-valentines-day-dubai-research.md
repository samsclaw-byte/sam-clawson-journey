## 💡 Pro Tips for New Parent Valentine's

1. **Lower expectations** - It's okay if it's not perfect. Being together matters.
2. **Plan B** - Have a backup plan in case baby is fussy/sick.
3. **Gift practicality** - Sophie might appreciate a spa voucher more than flowers right now.
4. **Include baby** - A small "from baby" gift/card melts hearts.
5. **Don't compare** - Your Valentine's won't look like Instagram. That's fine.
6. **Quality over quantity** - 1 hour of genuine connection beats 4 hours of fancy dinner where you're both stressed.

## 🎯 Final Recommendations

### If Budget is Flexible (AED 2,000-3,000):
1. Book **Talise Spa** couples massage for Saturday
2. **Private chef** dinner at home Friday evening
3. **Bateel dates + Patchi chocolates** + handwritten letter

### If Budget is Tight (AED 300-500):
1. **Cook dinner yourself** (Sophie's favorite)
2. **Flowers from 800Flower.ae** (AED 150-200)
3. **Personalized gift** - photo book or memory jar
4. **Movie night at home** with her favorite snacks

### The Can't-Fail Option:
**Ask Sophie what she wants.** New moms often just want: sleep, a shower alone, or someone to handle the baby while they rest. A "coupon book" of favors ("One full night of sleep while I handle the baby") might be the most romantic gift.

## Major System Fixes

### Cron Scheduler Fixed Permanently
- **Issue:** OpenClaw built-in cron scheduler (v2026.2.3-1) has bug #10353 - stops firing after gateway restart
- **Solution:** Migrated ALL cron jobs to Linux system crontab
- **Status:** 14 jobs now running via `crontab -e` 
- **Jobs:** Morning briefing (6am), Midday (12pm), Afternoon (3pm), Evening (8pm), Voice transcription (every 5min), Overnight build/research tasks (11pm-5am), Daily summary (midnight), Blog update (5:30am)
- **Verification:** Clean 14 jobs, no duplicates

## Health & Fitness Tracking Started

### Weight Tracking Initiated
- Starting weight: 104 kg (6'3" height, BMI 28.6)
- Goal range: 85-95 kg for optimal health
- Logging daily weigh-ins

### Food Logging Started
- Logging all meals with estimated nutrition
- Business lunch tracked (~1,550 cal)
- Protein shake + creatine logged
- Using `/home/samsclaw/.openclaw/workspace/health/weight-food-log.md`

### Creatine Research Completed
- 5g/day dosage confirmed optimal
- Benefits: Strength, cognitive function, bone health
- Very safe, well-researched supplement
- Research saved to: `research/creatine-benefits-research.md`

### Workouts Logged
- **Morning Run:** 27.1 min, Strain 13.4, 3,947 steps
  - Z1: 11.3 min, Z2: 8.5 min, Z4: 4.5 min, Z5: 2.8 min
- **Swim Session:** 23.4 min, Strain 10.1
  - Z1: 10.2 min, Z2: 9.1 min, Z4: 4.1 min
- Fixed HR zone entries to sum correctly to total duration

## WHOOP Integration

### Security Setup
- Created secure directory: `~/.config/whoop/` (700 permissions)
- Credentials file with 600 permissions
- Git exclusions added
- Setup script created: `scripts/setup-whoop-secure.sh`
- Documentation: `WHOOP_SECURITY_SETUP.md`

### Cost Analysis
- WHOOP membership: ~$30/month
- API: FREE (developer account)
- Integration: FREE (skills installed)
- Ready for setup when at laptop

## Cost Optimization

### Token Usage Optimized
- 60% cost reduction achieved
- Switched 7 jobs to Kimi K1 model
- Voice transcription: 2min→5min interval
- Estimated savings: ~$150/month
- Tracking: `COST_OPTIMIZATION.md`

## TAT Tasks Progress

### Completed Today
- ✅ Sunvisor for Theo (TAT Today - High priority)
- ✅ Car insurance (Andy/Libby)

### Pending
- UK Passport Renewal (3-Day)
- Fix Bath (7-Day)
- Valentine's Day for Sophie (Feb 14)

## Ideas & Tasks Added

### New Ideas in Notion
1. **Card Delivery App** - Moonpig clone for custom cards
2. **Multi-Agent Life Support** - Life coach, fitness coach, PA, nutritionist integration

## Daily Summaries

### Automation Created
- Midnight cron job generates daily summary
- Saves to `research/daily-summaries/YYYY-MM-DD-summary.md`
- Auto-pushes to GitHub
- First summary: Feb 5, 2026 created

## Technical Decisions

### Self-Hosting Analysis
- Kimi K2.5 cannot run locally (proprietary)
- Local LLMs: 10-100x more expensive than API
- Current setup (Kimi API) is most cost-effective
- RTX 4070 laptop would be good for local tools (QMD, Whisper) but not for running LLMs

### Memory Backend
- QMD (Query Markup Documents) identified as real tool (different from debunked "QMD memory upgrade")
- Requires Bun runtime + node-llama-cpp
- Decided against due to i5-1235U limitations
- Would work well on RTX 4070 laptop

## Key Learnings

1. **OpenClaw scheduler bug** is known issue (#10353, #10348) - affects v2026.2.3-1
2. **Linux cron** is bulletproof alternative for mission-critical schedules
3. **Health tracking** starts simple (text logs) → scales to API integration
4. **Security first** - WHOOP credentials need 600/700 permissions, git exclusions

## Files Created Today
- `crontab-complete.txt` - Complete cron schedule
- `scripts/setup-whoop-secure.sh` - WHOOP security setup
- `WHOOP_SECURITY_SETUP.md` - Security documentation
- `health/weight-food-log.md` - Health tracking
- `research/creatine-benefits-research.md` - Supplement research
- `daily-summaries/2026-02-05-summary.md` - First auto-summary

## Next Actions

1. **WHOOP setup** - Run setup script when at laptop
2. **Health tracking** - Continue logging weight + food
3. **Cron verification** - Monitor 8pm job tonight
4. **Overnight tasks** - Check build/research tasks ran
5. **Edamam API** - Set up for accurate food nutrition when ready

## Personal Context
- Last day of paternity leave with Sophie and Theo
- Celebrating with family time
- Focus on habits: 4/4 complete yesterday, tracking today

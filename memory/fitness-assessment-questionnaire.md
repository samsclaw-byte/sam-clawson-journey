## SECTION 1: CURRENT BASELINE

### 1.1 Daily Activity Level
**Question:** How active are you right now day-to-day? Walks, stairs, any exercise? Or is it mostly desk-to-couch?

**Sam's Answer:**
Haven't exercised much in the last two years — generally desk to couch. I do take the stairs at work (5 flights). On weekends am busy with kids, carrying 3-year-old on shoulders during walks.

### 1.2 Recent Exercise History
**Question:** When was the last time you exercised regularly? What were you doing and for how long?

### 2.1 Past Exercise Experience
**Question:** What kinds of exercise have you enjoyed in the past? Anything you absolutely hated?

**Sam's Answer:**
Enjoy a mix of running, swimming, Padel. Used to play football (soccer) twice per week but had an ACL injury so stopped. Have done yoga and BJJ for periods of time but not sustained for longer than 3 months. Quite enjoy circuits and kettlebells.

### 2.2 Sports Background
**Question:** Did you play any sports growing up or as an adult? Team sports, individual, martial arts?

## SECTION 3: INJURY & HEALTH HISTORY

### 3.1 The Calf Injuries
**Question:** Tell me about the calf injuries — when did they happen, what caused them, and have they fully healed?

**Sam's Answer:**
Training for marathon had repeated calf injuries, was running daily at that time — often 10K days. Was vegan, maybe lacking protein. Generally calf issues and not other muscle issues, had more groin injuries when playing football.

### 3.2 Other Injuries or Issues
**Question:** Any other injuries, aches, or health concerns I should know about? Back, knees, shoulders, etc.?

Sometimes have lower back issues (perhaps posture and air conditioning related). Want to manage and build calves and ACL and back to be able to ski etc in future. Would get turned ankles playing soccer but no issues there for some time.

### 3.3 Recovery Awareness
**Question:** How well do you know your body's warning signs? Do you push through pain or stop early?

**Sam's Answer:**
I try to push through. I tend to be feast and famine: I start training everyday, pushing myself then have injury and don't start retraining again.

---

## SECTION 4: EQUIPMENT & ENVIRONMENT

### 4.1 Available Equipment
**Question:** What do you have access to?
- [x] Gym membership (which gym?) — Basic community gym where I live with some weights, machines but very busy and difficult to always have access to equipment

- [ ] Just bodyweight
- [ ] Resistance bands — No
- [ ] Dumbbells (what weight range?)
- [ ] Barbell / rack
- [x] Cardio machines (treadmill, bike, rower?) — Road bike (needs repair) and static machine so can cycle while watching TV
- [x] Outdoor space for walks/runs — Available, back entrance to park. Summers in Dubai are hot! Have access to community swimming pool (25M), enjoy swimming

See above — mix of gym access (busy), home kettlebells, static bike, and outdoor park/pool access.

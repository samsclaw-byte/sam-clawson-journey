## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE: DAILY DECISION TREE

**Every Morning: Check Your WHOOP Recovery Score**

| Recovery | Color | Today's Focus | Max Duration |
|----------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| **67%+** | 🟢 Green | **HARD WORKOUT** | 30-45 min (up to 60 min Fri/weekend) |
| **50-66%** | 🟡 Yellow | **ACTIVE RECOVERY** | 20-30 min easy movement |
| **<50%** | 🔴 Red | **REST DAY** | 15 min stretching or complete rest |

> ⚠️ **Golden Rule:** When in doubt, choose the easier option. Consistency beats intensity every time.

## 🚨 THE NON-NEGOTIABLES

### Before EVERY Hard Workout: Calf Protocol (5-7 minutes)
Sam, your calves are your Achilles heel (literally). This isn't optional.

**Phase 1: Warm-Up (2 min)**
- 1 min: March in place → gentle jog on spot
- 1 min: Ankle circles (10 each direction, each foot)

**Phase 2: Activation (3 min)**
- 20 x Calf raises (slow, full range) — hold top 2 seconds
- 20 x Single-leg balance touches (light, controlled)
- 30 sec: Downward dog → pedal feet (stretch calves dynamically)
- 30 sec: World's greatest stretch (each side)

**Phase 3: Test (30 sec)**
- 10 gentle skips on spot
- **STOP if:** Sharp pain, tightness that doesn't ease, or "that feeling"

### 🚫 PROHIBITED EXERCISES — DO NOT DO THESE

These are banned until Month 3+ AND you've had 4 consecutive weeks without calf tightness:

| Exercise | Why It's Banned | Replacement |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Box jumps / Jump squats** | Explosive calf loading | Step-ups, goblet squats |
| **Sprints / Hill runs** | High-impact calf stress | Incline walk, slow jog |
| **Burpees with jump** | Explosive + impact | Walk-out burpees (no jump) |
| **Jump rope / Skipping** | Repetitive calf pounding | Shadow boxing (no rope) |
| **Heavy calf raises (>20kg)** | Excessive load | Bodyweight only, high reps |
| **Deep heavy squats** | ACL + back stress | Box squats to parallel, goblet squats |
| **Plyometric lunges** | ACL danger zone | Reverse lunges (static) |
| **High-rep running (10K+)** | Your injury pattern | Build to 5K max in Month 1-2 |

---

## 🗓️ PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal:** Build the habit + injury-proof your body  
**Frequency:** 3-4 days/week Hard, 2-3 days Active Recovery  
**Mindset:** "Show up and survive" — intensity comes later

## 🎯 SAM'S SUCCESS CHECKLIST

Print this and put it where you'll see it:

**Before Every Hard Workout:**
- [ ] Checked WHOOP (Green = go hard, Yellow = active recovery, Red = rest)
- [ ] Completed 5-7 min calf protocol
- [ ] Accepted that "good enough" beats "perfect"

**During Workouts:**
- [ ] Stopped if calves felt tight (no pushing through)
- [ ] Kept it to 30 min (unless Friday/weekend)
- [ ] Focused on form, not speed

**Weekly:**
- [ ] Minimum 3 hard workouts
- [ ] Maximum 2 rest days in a row
- [ ] At least 1 swim (you enjoy it — prioritize joy)

**Mindset:**
- [ ] "Something is better than nothing"
- [ ] "Rest is part of the program, not failure"
- [ ] "I broke the feast/famine cycle"

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### "My calves feel tight during warm-up"
→ STOP. Switch to active recovery (swim or bike). Try again tomorrow.

### "I missed 3 days, program is ruined"
→ NO. Just pick up where you left off. The only failure is quitting entirely.

### "WHOOP says Red but I feel fine"
→ Trust WHOOP. Do active recovery. Your body is fighting something you can't feel.

### "I'm bored of kettlebells"
→ Swap in a gym session. Or try a YouTube follow-along. Variety is allowed.

### "I want to run more"
→ Not until Month 3, and even then — slowly. Your calves need 8+ weeks of zero issues before building mileage.

### "I have energy for more"
→ Great! Use it for family time, not more exercise. Recovery = results.

## 💪 FINAL WORDS FROM YOUR TRAINER

Sam, you've been here before. The pattern is clear: **enthusiasm → overtraining → injury → quit.**

This program is designed to break that cycle. It's intentionally conservative. You'll feel like you could do more. **That's the point.** The guy who trains 4 days a week for a year beats the guy who trains 7 days a week for 2 months.

Your goals (half marathon, triathlon, 85-95kg) are absolutely achievable. But not by March. By September. And only if you stay uninjured.

**The calf protocol is non-negotiable.**  
**The WHOOP guidance is non-negotiable.**  
**The 30-minute limit (Mon-Thu) is non-negotiable.**

Everything else? Flexible. Life with a newborn is chaos. This program flows with that chaos, not against it.

You've got the kettlebells. You've got the pool. You've got the data (WHOOP). You've got the accountability (daily check-ins).

Now show up. Be boring. Be consistent. Build the habit.

**The results will come.**

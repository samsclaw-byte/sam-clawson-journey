- Created segregated **Work Tasks** database in Notion:
  - Located in 📋 Active Projects folder
  - Separate from personal TAT system
  - Features: Urgency (1/3/7 days), Project, Client, Priority, Assigned To, Waiting On
  - Status workflow: Not Started → In Progress → Blocked → Complete
- Planning to research Monday.com for more advanced work/CRM features
- Added personal task: Sort out wardrobe - bin old clothes (7 days, medium priority)

- All overnight build/research tasks completed successfully

## Afternoon/Evening
- Completed **Personal Trainer Fitness Assessment** (30 questions across 10 sections)
  - Documented full history: injuries (calf, ACL), exercise preferences, schedule constraints
  - Key insight: "Feast & famine" cycle (daily training → injury → quit)
  - Created flexible daily approach: WHOOP-based recovery zones
- **Security Sentinel deployed:**
  - Daily security audit script created
  - 6am cron job scheduled
  - Initial audit completed, fixed file permissions
- **Morning Brief system created:**
  - Integrates WHOOP + workout recommendations + trainer advice
  - 6am daily automation ready (pending WHOOP credentials)
- **Fitness Program v1 complete:**
  - "Flexible Daily" approach with recovery-based workout selection
  - Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
  - Calf-specific warm-up protocol (mandatory)
  - Prohibited exercises list (injury prevention)
  - Beautified HTML version created
- **Evening swim logged:** Active recovery session (8:30 PM, 20-30 min)

- **Water intake:** 5/8 glasses (62% of goal)

## Key Decisions Made
- **Workout approach:** Flexible daily (not rigid 3x/week) based on WHOOP recovery
  - Green (67%+): Hard workout
  - Yellow (50-66%): Active recovery
  - Red (<50%): Rest
- **Calf protocol:** Mandatory 5-7 min warm-up before every hard workout
- **Intensity rule:** 70% effort max — leave energy for tomorrow

## Pending

- First morning brief tomorrow 6am
